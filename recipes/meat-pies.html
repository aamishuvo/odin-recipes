    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pastry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cold salted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds ground meat</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried mixed herbs</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Sift flour into a bowl. Add chunks of cold butter. Use fingers to rub butter into flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until a non-sticky dough forms. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add  meat, onions, garlic, and carrots, and cook, stirring constantly, until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Add white pepper, curry powder, thyme, and mixed herbs, and mix well; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Remove from heat; set aside to cool.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>On a well-floured surface, roll dough out about 1/4-inch thick, and cut out circles using a cookie cutter, cup, or bowl in a size you are happy with. Place some filling in the center of the pastry circle and fold over carefully. Press the edges of the pastry firmly together with a fork to seal. Re-roll dough scraps, and repeat until pastry and meat filling are used up.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Place pies on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush the formed pies with beaten egg.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is hot, about 15 minutes. Enjoy!</p>
